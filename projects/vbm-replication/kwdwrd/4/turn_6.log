## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 4: Extension Dataset Ready

I have completed Phase 4. Here is the summary for your review:

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Extension data merged with original** - 1,454 original + 378 extension = 1,832 total observations
- [x] **Variables constructed correctly** - Treatment, vote shares, turnout calculated
- [x] **Summary statistics computed** - By state and period
- [x] **No unexpected missing values or outliers** - Missing patterns explained by data availability

### 1. Dataset Dimensions

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total observations** | 1,832 |
| **Original period (1996-2018)** | 1,454 |
| **Extension period (2020-2024)** | 378 |
| **Total counties** | 126 |
| **Total years** | 15 (1996-2018, 2020, 2022, 2024) |

#### By State

| State | Original | Extension | Total |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| California | 638 | 174 | 812 |
| Utah | 348 | 87 | 435 |
| Washington | 468 | 117 | 585 |

### 2. Summary Statistics Table

| Period | State | N | Counties | Years | Treat Rate | Mean Turnout | Mean Dem Share (Pres) |
|--------|-------|---|----------|-------|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Original | CA | 638 | 58 | 1998-2018 | 0.8% | 51.5% | 51.2% |
| Original | UT | 348 | 29 | 1996-2018 | 17.0% | 55.1% | 24.6% |
| Original | WA | 468 | 39 | 1996-2018 | 58.8% | 58.0% | 46.3% |
| Extension | CA | 174 | 58 | 2020-2024 | **43.1%** | 55.1% | 50.9% |
| Extension | UT | 87 | 29 | 2020-2024 | **100%** | 70.8% | 23.6% |
| Extension | WA | 117 | 39 | 2020-2024 | **100%** | 70.2% | 45.5% |

**Key observations:**
- California treatment rate increased dramatically from 0.8% to 43.1% (main source of new variation)
- Utah and Washington are now 100% treated (no new within-state variation)
- Turnout increased substantially in extension period (likely COVID/2020 effect)

### 3. Data Quality Concerns

**Missing data patterns (expected):**

| Variable | Missing | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `share_votes_dem` | 46.2% | Only available for CA/UT in original; requires voter files |
| `vbm_share` | 51.3% | Only available for CA/WA in original; not collected for extension |
| `dem_share_pres` | 48.1% | Only presidential years have this variable |
| `dem_share_gov` | 55.6% | Only gubernatorial election years (CA only in extension) |
| `dem_share_sen` | 66.6% | Only Senate election years in relevant states |

**No unexpected issues:**
- All 126 counties present in both periods
- Treatment coding verified (CA VCA counties correctly identified)
- Vote shares and turnout in reasonable ranges
- County IDs successfully matched between periods

---

### 4. Key Outputs

Files created:
- `data/processed/full_analysis_data.csv` - Combined analysis dataset (1,832 obs)
- `output/tables/summary_stats_extended.csv` - Summary statistics by state/period

**Treatment variation summary:**
- **California**: Substantial new variation (5 VCA counties in 2018 → ~25 by 2024)
- **Utah**: No new variation (100% treated by 2020)
- **Washington**: No new variation (100% treated since 2011)

The extension analysis will primarily leverage California's continued VCA rollout.

**STOP: Please review the above and approve to proceed to Phase 5 (Extension Analysis).**
