The project is now complete. All phases have been finished:

**Final Project Summary**

| Phase | Status | Key Output |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 0. Setup | Complete | Cloned original repo, created directory structure |
| 1. Literature Review | Complete | `notes/literature_review.md`, `notes/extension_rationale.md` |
| 2. Replication | Complete | Tables 2 & 3 replicate exactly |
| 3. Data Collection | Complete | 378 extension observations (2020-2024) |
| 4. Data Preparation | Complete | 1,832 combined observations |
| 5. Extension Analysis | Complete | All 6 tasks completed |
| 6. Paper Writing | Complete | `paper/replication_paper.md` |
| 7. Code Organization | Complete | `code/run_all.py`, updated README |

**Key Finding**: Universal vote-by-mail continues to have no meaningful partisan effect in the post-COVID era. The interaction test (p=0.67) shows no evidence that VBM effects changed between the original period (1996-2018) and the extension period (2020-2024).

To run the complete analysis:
```bash
cd vbm_replication
python code/run_all.py
```

All deliverables are in place:
- `paper/replication_paper.md` - Full academic paper
- `output/tables/` - All result tables (9 CSV files)
- `output/figures/event_study.png` - Event study visualization
- `notes/` - Documentation and analysis notes
