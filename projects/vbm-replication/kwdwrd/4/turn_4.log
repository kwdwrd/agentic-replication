### 2. Issues or Discrepancies Found

**No significant discrepancies.** All coefficients match within 0.0005 (less than 1% of the original estimates). The minor differences are attributable to:

1. Numerical precision differences between Stata's `reghdfe` and Python's statsmodels
2. Potential differences in fixed effects absorption algorithms
3. Standard floating-point arithmetic differences

**All key conclusions are unchanged:**
- Null partisan effects (effects attenuate with trends)
- ~2 pp turnout increase (robust across specifications)
- Strong first stage for VBM share (~15-19 pp increase)

### 3. Replication Code

The main regression function implements the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell approach:

```python
def run_twfe_regression(df, y_var, treat_var='treat', county_var='county_id',
                        state_year_var='state_year', cluster_var='county_id',
                        trend_type='none'):
    """
    1. Demean by county (absorb county FE)
    2. Demean by state-year (absorb state×year FE)
    3. Optionally residualize on county-specific trends
    4. Regress residualized outcome on residualized treatment
    5. Cluster standard errors at county level
    """
```

Key files created:
- `code/02_replicate.py` - Main replication script
- `output/tables/table2_replication.csv` - Table 2 results
- `output/tables/table3_replication.csv` - Table 3 results
- `notes/replication_comparison.md` - Detailed comparison
