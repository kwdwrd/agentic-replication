## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 1: Literature Review Complete

I have completed Phase 1. Here is the summary for your review:

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Original paper thoroughly summarized** - Created `notes/original_paper_summary.md`
- [x] **Literature review completed with verified citations** - Created `notes/literature_review.md` with 11 verified papers
- [x] **Extension rationale documented** - Created `notes/extension_rationale.md`
- [x] **All papers cited have been verified to exist** - Each paper confirmed via web search

---

### 1. Contents of `notes/original_paper_summary.md`

The document contains:
- **Research question**: Does universal VBM affect partisan outcomes?
- **Identification strategy**: Staggered county-level adoption within CA, UT, WA using difference-in-differences
- **Data**: 126 counties, 1996-2018, county-year-election unit of analysis
- **Estimating equation**: Y_cst = β(VBM_cst) + γ_cs + δ_st + ε_cst
- **Key findings from Tables 2 & 3**:
  - Dem turnout share: 0.007 (0.003) → 0.001 (0.001) with trends
  - Dem vote share: 0.028 (0.011) → 0.007 (0.003) with trends
  - Turnout: +2.1 pp, robust across specifications
  - VBM share: +14-19 pp (strong first stage)
- **Robustness checks**: State-by-state results, leads analysis, heterogeneity tests

### 3. Extension Rationale Summary

**What changed after 2018?**
- COVID-19 pandemic caused emergency VBM expansions
- VBM became a partisan issue (59% Dem vs 30% Rep usage in 2020)
- California VCA continued to roll out (5 counties in 2018 → 14-15 in 2020 → 30 by 2024)

**What new variation exists?**
- **California**: Substantial (major additions including LA and Orange counties)
- **Utah**: Minimal (2 counties adopted in 2020)
- **Washington**: None (100% VBM since 2011)

**Research questions**:
1. Do null partisan effects hold post-COVID?
2. Is there heterogeneity by time period (pre vs. post 2018)?
3. Do event study patterns look similar?

**Key limitations**:
- Less new variation than original paper
- Cannot separate VBM from COVID effects in 2020
- California-specific results may not generalize
- Potential treatment effect heterogeneity concerns (per recent DiD literature)

**STOP: Please review the above and approve to proceed to Phase 2 (Replication with Original Data).**
