## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 0: Project Setup Complete

I have completed Phase 0. Here is the summary for your review:

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Project directory structure created** - Full structure with `original/`, `code/`, `data/`, `notes/`, `output/`, and `logs/` directories
- [x] **Original replication materials downloaded** - Cloned from https://github.com/stanford-dpl/vbm
- [x] **Original code reviewed and documented** - Key .do files examined, workflow understood
- [x] **Data files inventory complete** - All 20 .dta files catalogued with dimensions
- [x] **Stata-to-Python translations identified** - Documented in notes and INSTRUCTIONS.md

---

### 1. Contents of `notes/original_materials_review.md`

The document contains:
- **File inventory** of all 29 code files and 20+ data files
- **Main analysis dataset structure**: 1,454 observations × 134 variables
- **Treatment variable coding**:
  - California: 5 VCA counties in 2018 (Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, San Mateo)
  - Utah: Progressive rollout 2012-2018 (1→9→11→6 counties)
  - Washington: Near-complete by 2006 (29 counties), all by 2012
- **Key variable definitions**: `treat`, `share_votes_dem`, `dem_share_*`, `turnout_share`, `vbm_share`
- **Stata command translations**: `reghdfe`, clustering, fixed effects specifications

### 2. List of Original Data Files and Dimensions

| File | Rows × Columns | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **analysis.dta** | 1,454 × 134 | Main analysis dataset |
| policies.dta | 2,179 × 12 | VBM policy adoption |
| participation.dta | 1,240 × 17 | Turnout data |
| governor.dta | 1,317 × 7 | Gubernatorial results |
| president.dta | 911 × 7 | Presidential results |
| senator.dta | 544 × 5 | Senate results |
| county_cvap.dta | 41,808 × 6 | CVAP by county-year |
| composition.dta | 2,798 × 13 | Voter composition |
| ca_votes_by_group.dta | 767,695 × 5 | CA demographic votes |
| ut_votes_by_group.dta | 174,952 × 5 | UT demographic votes |

### 3. Issues or Concerns Accessing Original Materials

**No major issues encountered:**
- Repository cloned successfully
- All .dta files readable with pandas
- Data structure matches what the paper describes

**Minor notes:**
- Washington lacks `share_votes_dem` (partisan turnout) data - consistent with paper's footnote
- Utah lacks `vbm_share` data - consistent with paper
- VBM share exceeds 1.0 slightly in a few cases (1.000089) - likely rounding in original data

### Key Stata-to-Python Translations

| Stata | Python | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `reghdfe Y treat, a(county_id state_year) vce(clust county_id)` | `PanelOLS` with entity_effects + state-year dummies, clustered SEs | Need to handle state-year as separate dummies |
| `a(county_id##c.year)` | Create county×year interaction term, include as absorbed FE | County-specific linear trends |
| `a(county_id##c.year county_id##c.year2)` | Add county×year² interaction | Quadratic trends |
| `distinct` | `pd.Series.nunique()` | Count unique values |
| `reshape long` | `pd.melt()` | For vote share by office analysis |
