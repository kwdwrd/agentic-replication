The replication and extension project for Thompson et al. (2020) "Universal Vote-by-Mail Has No Impact on Partisan Turnout or Vote Share" is ready. 

**Main finding**: The null partisan effect of universal VBM is robust to including the 2020 presidential election. The California-specific difference-in-differences estimate is -0.004 (SE = 0.007), statistically indistinguishable from zero.

To reproduce all analyses, run:
```bash
cd vbm_replication
python code/00_run_all.py
