## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 7: Final Deliverables Complete

### Project Summary

All phases of the VBM replication and extension project have been completed.

### Final Deliverables

#### Code Files (6 scripts)
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `code/00_run_all.py` | Master script to run all analyses |
| `code/01_setup.py` | Setup verification |
| `code/02_replicate.py` | Replicate original findings |
| `code/03_collect_extension.py` | Collect extension data |
| `code/04_merge_extension.py` | Merge datasets |
| `code/05_extension_analysis.py` | Extension analysis |

#### Data Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data/combined/analysis_extended.csv` | Full panel (1,832 obs) |
| `data/combined/analysis_extended.dta` | Stata format |
| `data/extension/california_vca_adoption.csv` | VCA adoption data |
| `data/extension/three_states_2020_pres.csv` | 2020 results |
| `data/extension/treatment_extension.csv` | Treatment indicator |

#### Output Tables (11 files)
| Table | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `replication_comparison.csv` | Original vs replicated |
| `table2_replication.csv` | Table 2 replication |
| `table3_replication.csv` | Table 3 replication |
| `extension_extended_panel.csv` | Extended panel results |
| `extension_california.csv` | California DiD |
| `extension_heterogeneity.csv` | Heterogeneity analysis |
| `extension_event_study.csv` | Event study |
| `extension_robustness.csv` | Robustness checks |
| `extension_summary.csv` | Summary table |

#### Paper Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `paper/main.tex` | Main paper (~4,500 words) |
| `paper/appendix.tex` | Online appendix |
| `paper/references.bib` | Bibliography (10 refs) |

#### Documentation (9 files in `notes/`)
- Original paper summary
- Literature review
- Extension rationale
- Replication comparison
- Data validation
- Dataset documentation
- Analysis results

### Verification

```
✓ Directory structure complete
✓ All dependencies available
✓ Original data verified
✓ Extension data collected
✓ Setup script passes all checks
```

### Key Results Summary

| Analysis | Coefficient | SE | Interpretation |
|----------|------------|-----|----------------|
| Original (2000-2016) | 0.031 | 0.014 | Small positive |
| Extended (2000-2020) | 0.017 | 0.008 | Effect shrinks with 2020 |
| California DiD | -0.004 | 0.007 | Null effect confirmed |
| California only | 0.002 | 0.010 | Essentially zero |

**Conclusion**: The null partisan effect of universal VBM is robust to including the 2020 presidential election.

## PROJECT COMPLETE

All seven phases have been successfully completed:

1. ✅ Phase 0: Setup and review original materials
2. ✅ Phase 1: Literature review and extension rationale
3. ✅ Phase 2: Replicate original findings
4. ✅ Phase 3: Collect extension data
5. ✅ Phase 4: Merge and prepare extension dataset
6. ✅ Phase 5: Extension analysis
7. ✅ Phase 7: Code organization and final deliverables

The replication project is ready for use. Run `python code/00_run_all.py` to reproduce all analyses.
