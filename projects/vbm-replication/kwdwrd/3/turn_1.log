## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 0: Project Setup Complete

I have completed Phase 0 of the VBM replication project. Here is a summary for your review:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Project directory structure created** with all required folders:
   - `vbm_replication/original/` - Original materials
   - `vbm_replication/code/` - Analysis code
   - `vbm_replication/data/` - Data files
   - `vbm_replication/notes/` - Documentation
   - `vbm_replication/output/` - Tables, figures, paper

2. **Original replication materials downloaded** from https://github.com/stanford-dpl/vbm

3. **Original code reviewed and documented** in `notes/original_materials_review.md`

4. **Key Stata-to-Python translations identified** in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Key Data Files Inventory

| File | Dimensions | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `analysis.dta` | 1,454 × 134 | **Main analysis dataset** |
| `policies.dta` | 2,179 × 12 | VBM adoption dates |
| `participation.dta` | 1,240 × 17 | Turnout and VBM share |
| `governor.dta` | 1,317 × 7 | Gubernatorial results |
| `president.dta` | 911 × 7 | Presidential results |
| `senator.dta` | 544 × 5 | Senate results |

**Main analysis dataset (analysis.dta):**
- **126 counties**: 58 CA + 29 UT + 39 WA
- **Years**: 1996-2018 (general elections only)
- **Treatment (VBM)**: 339 treated obs (23.3%), 1,115 control (76.7%)

---

### Main Analysis Scripts Identified

**Table 2** (Partisan Outcomes): `make_partisan_turnout_table.do`
- Outcomes: Democratic turnout share, Democratic vote share
- Specifications: Basic, linear trends, quadratic trends

**Table 3** (Participation Outcomes): `make_participation_table.do`
- Outcomes: Turnout rate, VBM share
- Same specifications

### Stata-to-Python Translation Summary

| Stata | Python | Verified? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `reghdfe Y treat, a(county_id state_year)` | `PanelOLS` with entity+time effects | ✅ Yes - tested |
| `vce(cluster county_id)` | `cov_type='clustered', cluster_entity=True` | ✅ Yes |
| County trends | Manual demeaning or interactions | Needs implementation |

**Verification Test**: Running the Table 2, Column 1 specification in Python:
- Original: VBM coefficient = 0.007 (SE = 0.003)
- Python test: VBM coefficient = 0.0072 (SE = 0.0033) ✅ Match

---

### Issues/Concerns

1. **County-specific trends** (Columns 2-3 in Tables 2 and 3): Will require manual implementation of within-county demeaning or interaction terms, as `linearmodels` doesn't directly support `county##c.year` syntax.

2. **Missing data patterns**: Different outcomes have different sample sizes due to data availability:
   - Democratic turnout share: Only CA and UT (not WA)
   - VBM share: Only CA

3. **All packages available**: Confirmed `linearmodels` and `statsmodels` are installed.

**Please review and approve to proceed to Phase 1 (Literature Review and Background Research).**
