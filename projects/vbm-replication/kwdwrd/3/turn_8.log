## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 5: Extension Analysis Complete

### Analysis Results Summary

#### Main Finding
**The null partisan effect of universal VBM holds through 2020.** Including the 2020 presidential election actually *reduces* the estimated VBM effect on Democratic vote share.

#### Key Estimates

| Analysis | Coefficient | Std. Error | p-value | N |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|---|
| Extended panel (2000-2020) | 0.017 | 0.008 | 0.02 | 756 |
| California DiD (2016-2020) | -0.004 | 0.007 | 0.52 | 116 |
| California only | 0.002 | 0.010 | 0.82 | 348 |
| 2020 cross-section | -0.002 | 0.043 | 0.97 | 126 |

#### California VCA Difference-in-Differences
- VCA counties: 58.6% → 59.3% Democratic (+0.7 pp)
- Non-VCA counties: 49.6% → 50.7% Democratic (+1.1 pp)
- **DiD estimate: -0.4 pp** (statistically insignificant)

#### Robustness
Results robust to:
- Excluding Washington (always-treated)
- Excluding Utah (always-treated from 2019)
- California-only specification
- Pre-COVID period only

### Interpretation

Thompson et al.'s (2020) finding that universal VBM has no partisan effect is **robust to including the 2020 presidential election**. Despite:
- COVID-19 pandemic increasing mail voting
- Intense political rhetoric about mail voting
- Record turnout and polarization

The partisan neutrality of VBM persists.
