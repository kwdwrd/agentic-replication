## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 1: Literature Review Complete

I have completed Phase 1 of the project. Here is a summary for your review:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Original paper thoroughly summarized** (`notes/original_paper_summary.md`)
2. **Literature review completed with verified citations** (`notes/literature_review.md`)
3. **Extension rationale documented** (`notes/extension_rationale.md`)

### 1. Original Paper Summary (Key Points)

**Research Question**: Does universal VBM affect partisan election outcomes?

**Design**: Difference-in-differences exploiting staggered county-level VBM adoption in CA, UT, WA (1996-2018)

**Key Findings**:
| Outcome | Basic Spec | With Trends |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Dem turnout share | 0.007 (0.003) | 0.001 (0.001) |
| Dem vote share | 0.028 (0.011) | 0.007 (0.003) |
| Turnout | 0.021 (0.009) | 0.021 (0.008) |

**Conclusion**: No meaningful partisan effects; modest (~2pp) turnout increase

**All 10 papers have been verified to exist** through web searches with correct citations.

### 3. Extension Rationale Summary

**What changed after 2018?**
- COVID-19 pandemic changed VBM from convenience feature to health necessity
- VBM became a partisan issue (10-20pp gap in preferences)
- California continued VCA rollout (5 → 30 counties)

**New variation available**:
| State | New Variation 2020-2024 |
|-------|------------------------|
| California | 25 new VCA counties (including LA, Orange, San Diego) |
| Utah | None (100% VBM since 2019) |
| Washington | None (100% VBM since 2011) |

**Key limitations to acknowledge**:
1. Less new variation than original paper
2. Cannot separate VBM effects from COVID effects in 2020
3. Post-2020 political context fundamentally different

### California VCA Adoption Timeline (Key for Extension)

| Year | Counties | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| 2018 | 5 | Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, San Mateo |
| 2020 | +10 (15 total) | Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Clara, Fresno |
| 2022 | +13 (28 total) | San Diego, Alameda, Riverside, Marin |
| 2024 | +2 (30 total) | Imperial, Placer |

---

### Issues/Concerns

1. **Limited identifying variation**: Extension relies primarily on California VCA rollout; Utah and Washington contribute no new variation

2. **COVID confounds**: The 2020 election was exceptional in many ways beyond VBM

3. **Modern DiD concerns**: Goodman-Bacon, Callaway-Sant'Anna, and Sun-Abraham highlight potential issues with TWFE and staggered adoption that should be considered for robustness

**Please review and approve to proceed to Phase 2 (Replication with Original Data).**
