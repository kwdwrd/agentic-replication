The project is fully complete. All tasks have been finished:

1. **Replication** - Successfully replicated Tables 2 and 3 from Thompson et al. (2020)
2. **Extension data collection** - Gathered 2020-2024 election data for CA, UT, WA
3. **Extension analysis** - Ran DiD regressions on the new data
4. **Documentation** - Created comprehensive summaries and checkpoint notes

The key findings are:
- **Partisan effects:** Null in both original and extension (VBM doesn't favor either party)
- **Turnout effects:** +2pp in original, null in extension (likely due to COVID-19 context)

All code and results are saved in the `vbm_replication/` directory. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this project?
