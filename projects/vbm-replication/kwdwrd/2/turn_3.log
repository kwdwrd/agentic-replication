## 🛑 CHECKPOINT 1: Literature Review Complete

### Summary of What Has Been Completed:

1. **Original paper thoroughly summarized** in `notes/original_paper_summary.md`
2. **Literature review completed** with 11 verified citations in `notes/literature_review.md`
3. **Extension rationale documented** in `notes/extension_rationale.md`

### 1. Contents of `notes/original_paper_summary.md`

**Research Question**: Does universal vote-by-mail affect partisan electoral outcomes (turnout composition, vote share, overall turnout)?

**Identification Strategy**: Difference-in-differences exploiting staggered county-level VBM adoption across California, Utah, and Washington (1996-2018). Key identifying assumption is parallel trends.

**Estimating Equation**:
$$Y_{cst} = \beta \cdot VBM_{cst} + \gamma_{cs} + \delta_{st} + \epsilon_{cst}$$

**Key Findings**:
- **Partisan effects**: Near-zero effects on Democratic turnout share (0.001 with trends) and vote share (0.007 with trends)
- **Turnout**: VBM increases overall turnout by ~2 percentage points
- **VBM usage**: 14-19 pp increase in mail ballot share

### 3. Extension Rationale Summary

**What changed post-2018?**
- COVID-19 pandemic and emergency VBM expansion
- VBM became a partisan issue (20 pp gap in attitudes by June 2020)
- California VCA continued rollout: 5 counties (2018) → 30 counties (2024)

**New variation available**:
- California: 25 new VCA counties (2020-2024), including Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange
- Utah/Washington: Fully treated by 2019-2020, no new variation

**Research questions**:
1. Do null partisan effects hold post-COVID?
2. Is there heterogeneity by time period?
3. Are California VCA effects consistent with earlier findings?

**Key limitations**:
- Less variation than original (primarily California)
- Cannot separate VBM effects from COVID effects in 2020
- Staggered DiD methodological concerns

**STOP: Awaiting approval to proceed to Phase 2 (Replication with Original Data).**
