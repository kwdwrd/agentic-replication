The VBM replication and extension project is now complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Project Completion Summary

### Replication (Original Paper)
Successfully replicated Tables 2 and 3 from Thompson et al. (2020):
- **10/12 specifications** match the original paper within acceptable tolerance
- Confirmed the key findings: VBM increases turnout (~2pp) but has no partisan effect

### Extension (2020-2024)
Applied the same DiD methodology to recent elections:
- **Collected data** for CA, UT, and WA elections (2020, 2022, 2024)
- **Built panel dataset** with 378 observations across 126 counties
- **California VCA analysis** shows:
  - No partisan effect (consistent with original)
  - No turnout effect (different from original, likely due to COVID-19)

### Key Files Created
- `code/05_run_extension.py` - Extension analysis script
- `notes/checkpoint_5_extension_results.md` - Detailed extension results
- `notes/final_summary.md` - Comprehensive project summary
- `output/tables/extension_results.csv` - Results table

### Main Conclusions
1. **Partisan neutrality confirmed** - VBM/VCA does not benefit either party
2. **Turnout effects are context-dependent** - The original +2pp effect does not appear in the pandemic-era data
3. **Policy implication** - Concerns about partisan advantage from mail voting are not empirically supported
