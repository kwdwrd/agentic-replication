The project is complete. The linter changes to `05_run_extension.py` are consistent with my edits - they show the fixed code with proper string formatting and the updated conclusions section.

To summarize the completed VBM replication and extension project:

**Replication Results:**
- Successfully replicated 10/12 specifications from the original Thompson et al. (2020) paper
- Key findings confirmed: VBM has no partisan effect, increases turnout by ~2pp

**Extension Results (2020-2024):**
- California VCA DiD analysis: No partisan effect (-0.009, p=0.41), no turnout effect (-0.005, p=0.63)
- The null partisan finding is consistent with the original paper
- The null turnout finding differs, likely due to COVID-19 pandemic effects on 2020 baseline

**All deliverables are in place:**
- `code/02_replicate.py` - Original replication
- `code/05_run_extension.py` - Extension analysis
- `output/tables/` - Results tables (CSV files)
- `notes/final_summary.md` - Comprehensive summary
- `notes/checkpoint_5_extension_results.md` - Extension documentation

The main policy conclusion remains robust: **VBM/VCA expansion is politically neutral** - it does not systematically benefit either party.
